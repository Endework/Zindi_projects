# Alvin Smart Money Management Classification

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm that classifies purchases into 13 distinct categories. The project was undertaken as part of a challenge hosted by Zindi.

## Data
The datasets for this project were obtained from [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/alvin-smart-money-management-classification-challenge/data). The data includes various features such as the time the merchant was categorized by the customer, the name of the merchant, the category the merchant was assigned by the customer, the value of the purchase made by the customer, and more.

## Methodology
The project involves several steps including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation. Various models were applied, including logistic regression, decision tree, XGBoost, and random forest.

## Results
The best performing models were the random forest classifier and XGBoost, both achieving 88% accuracy.

## Future Work
Future work could involve exploring more sophisticated techniques for handling class imbalance, conducting more extensive feature engineering, or applying more advanced models. Additionally, more rigorous hyperparameter tuning could potentially improve the model's performance.
